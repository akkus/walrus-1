The Walrus and the Carpenter
by Lewis Carroll

The sun was shining on the land,
Shining with all his might;
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
and this was odd, because it ws
the middle of the night!

The moon was shining sulkily
because she thought the sun
had got no business to be there
after the day was done
"it's very rude of him, she said
to come and spoil the fun!
